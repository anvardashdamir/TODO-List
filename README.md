To-Do List App

A simple, user-friendly to-do list application built in Swift for iOS.
This app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, with persistent storage to save tasks across app launches. 
Key features include:

Custom UITableView Cells:      Each task is displayed in a custom cell with a checkbox and editable text field.
Interactive UI:                Users can mark tasks as completed by tapping the checkbox, with strikethrough text indicating completion status.
Persistent Storage:            Tasks are saved using UserDefaults, allowing them to persist when the app is closed and reopened.
Automatic Keyboard Handling:   The keyboard automatically opens for new tasks, and the "Done" button dismisses it smoothly.

This project demonstrates experience with UIKit, UITableView customization, data persistence, and interactive UI components.
